											It is said that Lu’an Guapian Tea is derived from magic tea. According to the tale, there was a farmer named Hu Lin in Mabu Town of Jinzhai, who was good at tea making. One day, he went to Qiyun Mountain to pick tea for his employer. He came to a cliff with full of tall, old trees and few people. All of a sudden, he found several exotic tea trees among the stone walls, luxurant and verdant. The buds and leaves were covered with a layer of white fume, shining with silver light, which was clearly different from other tea trees. Hu Lin was very good at distinguishing the quality of tea trees. After observing them carefully, he knew that the tea trees in front of him were extremely rare and precious varieties. So, he carefully picked fresh leaves,  fried them into tea and brought it down the mountain to go home. He stopped at a teahouse because of he dad been tired for all the work he had done. Out of curiosity, he took out the tea he had with him to brew. As soon as the boiling water being poured into the teacup, a layer of foam could be seen floating in the teacup, just like the auspicious clouds fluttering, and like the golden lotus in full bloom, and suddenly the aroma was permeating all over the house. The guests in the teahouse were attracted by the aroma and agreed with one voice: “Good tea!” Seeing how delicious the tea was, Hu Lin went back to the mountain to look for the tea trees he had found among the cliffs. But once again, it was nowhere to be found. Locals consider it a “magic tea” that cannot be recovered. Some years after this story was spread, some tea trees were found in the bat cave in Qi Mountain. It was said that the tea trees were born by bats. These tea trees are exactly the same as those described by Hu Lin, so people naturally call them “magic tea”.</p>

				<h3>Hui Tea “Going Out”</h3>
				<p>As early as in Ming and Qing Dynasties, Huizhou Tea was famous with the power of Huizhou merchants. However, it is difficult now for Huizhou Tea to go overseas. One of the difficulties is the cultural obstacle. The West knows litter of Hui Tea. The international status of Hui Tea needs to be improved. Under the background of “ going out” national strategy, the promotion of Hui Tea culture can lay a foundation for internationalization of Hui Tea. Hui tea has a long history and rich connotations. Introducing Hui Tea culture, as the first step of popularization, can help Anhui tea enterprises to “ go out” and bring new opportunities for the economic development of Anhui.
