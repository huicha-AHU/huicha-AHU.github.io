										<h1>Yellow Mountain Maofeng Tea</h1>
										<b><p style="color: white">“It has strong bud and golden pieces of leaves like finch tongue; its smell is fragrant and lasting and its taste mellow and sweet.” Yellow Mountain Maofeng Tea is formerly known as cloud tea, according to Yellow Mountain Annalae, “The tea growing near stone gap of the Lotus Nunnery is fragrant and good-flavor, called Huangshan cloud tea.” Jiang Cheng, a scholar of the Tang Dynasty, also wrote in his article: “The cloud tea of Yellow Mountain is produced from the mountain peaks, which is surrounded by rippling clouds and thick fog. This tea has elegant smell, great fragrance and delicate taste, being the NO.1 among all of the tea.” About the origin of Yellow Mountain Maofeng Tea, according to recording materials of Huizhou Chamber of Commerce, in the early reign of Qing’s emperor Guangxu (1875), the tea merchant Xie Zhengan opened “Xie Yu Da” tea shops to cater to the market demand. He came to some tea-producing regions in Yellow Mountain such as Chongchuan and Tangkou in the flesh to choose good bud and leaf. After being fine fried, the excellent quality tea with a delicate flavor is created. Because the tea has white hairs, peak-like bud tip, it is named “Maofeng” in Chinese, and then named with the name of “Yellow Mountain Maofeng Tea”.</p>

										<p>During the reign of Tianqi in the Ming Dynasty, Xiong Kaiyuan, the newly appointed magistrate of Yixian county in Jiangnan, got lost on a spring trip to Yellow mountain with his schoolchildren. When the elder made tea to serve the guest, the magistrate carefully observed that the tea was yellowish in color, like a bird's tongue in the shape, and covered by whittish. When the boiling water was poured into the tea, he saw that the hot air revolved around the edge of the bowl and straight up to the center of the bowl about a foot high, and then turned around in a circle in the air and turned into a form of white lotus flower. The white lotus then flew slowly and turned into a mass of clouds, and finally scattered into a wisp of hot air and blew out. The fragrance of the tea then filled the room. The county magistrate asked the rear to know that the tea is called Yellow Mountain Maofeng Tea. When parting, the elders presented a bag of tea and a calabash from Yellow Mountain spring water, and told them to brew with the spring water in order to appear the white lotus scenery. After returning to the county government, the magistrate Xiong met the magistrate of Taiping County, a schoolmate and former friend of him, who visited him and performed the brewing of Yellow Mountain Maofeng Tea for him. The magistrate of Taiping was very surprised, and later went to the capital to report to the emperor with the wish to offer this fairy tea for win the reward of the emperor. Then the emperor ordered the him to come to the palace for performance, but he did not see the white lotus scenery appeared. The emperor was furious, so the magistrate of Taiping had to be truly said that it was magistrate of Yi County Xiong Kaiyuan offered this tea. The emperor immediately ordered Xiong Kaiyuan to go to the palace for trial. After Xiong Kaiyuan went to the palace, he knew that he did not use spring water from Yellow Mountain to brew it, and was asked to go back to Yellow Mountain for water. Xiong Kaiyuan came to Yellow Mountain to visit the elders to ask for the spring water. Then he brewed the tea again in the jade cup in front of the emperor. As expected, there was a white lotus spectacle. The emperor smiled, then said to Xiong: “I promote you as governor of the south of the Yangtze River. You should go three days later to take office.” There were many thoughts in the mind of Xiong, and he secretly said, “Even if for the tea of Yellow Mountain, it has high quality, let alone for human?” So he took off his official clothes and jade belt and became a monk in the Yungu Temple of Yellow Mountain and his name in the temple was Zhengzhi. Now along the road under the Yungu Temple, there is a tomb, which is the tomb of monk Zhengzhi in tales.</p>

				<h3>Hui Tea “Going Out”</h3>
				<p>As early as in Ming and Qing Dynasties, Huizhou Tea was famous with the power of Huizhou merchants. However, it is difficult now for Huizhou Tea to go overseas. One of the difficulties is the cultural obstacle. The West knows litter of Hui Tea. The international status of Hui Tea needs to be improved. Under the background of “ going out” national strategy, the promotion of Hui Tea culture can lay a foundation for internationalization of Hui Tea. Hui tea has a long history and rich connotations. Introducing Hui Tea culture, as the first step of popularization, can help Anhui tea enterprises to “ go out” and bring new opportunities for the economic development of Anhui.
