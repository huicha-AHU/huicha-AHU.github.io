										<h1>Taiping Houkui Tea</h1>
										<b><p style="color: white">In the 26th year under the reign of Guangxu Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1900), a tea farmer named Wang Kuicheng (1861-1909, known as “Wang Lao’er”, whose ancestors came from Sanshilipu, Lujiang County), who lived in Hougang, carefully selected one strong bud and two leaves in the Gaoshan Tea Garden at Fenghuangjian. After being fine processed, the tea he produced was called “Wang Lao’er Kuijian” with good quality and high standard. Because its quality is the leader of sharp tea, the founder is also named Kuicheng(king), and is produced near the area of Houkeng and Hougang in Taiping County. Therefore, the tea is called “Taiping Houkui Tea”.</p></b>

										<p>Its appearance is flat and straight, slightly sharp at both ends. There is a saying goes like that “Houkui Tea has two sharp points without being loose nor warped nor curling edge”. Veins in the tea leaves are slightly red, commonly known as “red thread”. The color of the tea is green, the whitish is much but not obvious, the aroma is like the orchid fragrance, the taste is mellow and the aftertaste is very impressive. The dry tea of Houkui Tea belongs to the kind of flat tea. The color of the high-quality Taiping Houkui Tea is obviously different from that of other famous teas -- that is, the color of the dry tea is “green and smooth”. “Smooth” means that the tea bar is dark green and shiny, and the color is very uniform without miscellaneous pattern without dry and dark image. The tea soup of high grade Houkui Tea should be green, clear and bright. Light green is the color similar with that of green apple and the tea soup is very clear, transparent, bright and not cloudy. The color of Houkui Tea is stable, and it is not easy to be oxidized and is hard to turn yellow and red. The high-grade Houkui Tea contains attractive orchid fragrance, which is strong and persistent when it is sniffed even if the soup is cold.</p>

										<p>In ancient times, a pair of white-haired monkeys lived in Yellow Mountain and gave birth to a baby hairy monkey. One day, the baby hairy monkey went out to play alone. When it came to Taiping County, it got caught in the heavy fog and got lost. The old monkeys immediately went out to look for their child. A few days later, they were so eager to find their son that they died of illness in a mountain pit in Taiping County. When a old man found the dead old monkeys, he buried them on the hill and planted some wild tea and flowers next to the old monkeys’ tomb. When he was about to leave, he heard a voice saying, “Old man, you have done a good thing for us. we must thank you.” But nobody was there, and the old man did not care about it. The next spring, the old man came to pick wild tea and found that the whole hill was covered with green tea trees. While the old man was wondering about this, he suddenly heard someone say to him, “we have given you these tea trees”. Cultivate them carefully and you will have enough to eat and wear in the future." Then the old man realized that the tea trees were given by the monkeys. From then on, the old man had a good tea hill, and he did not need to climb over the mountains to pick wild tea. To commemorate the sacred monkeys, the old man called this hill Monkey Hill (Houshan), the mountain hole he lived in Monkey Pit ( Houkeng), and the tea he picked from the hill Monkey Tea (Hou Tea). Because the quality of Hou Tea is superior, it was called No.1 in tea (Kui), and later this tea was named Taiping Houkui Tea.</p>

				<h3>Hui Tea “Going Out”</h3>
				<p>As early as in Ming and Qing Dynasties, Huizhou Tea was famous with the power of Huizhou merchants. However, it is difficult now for Huizhou Tea to go overseas. One of the difficulties is the cultural obstacle. The West knows litter of Hui Tea. The international status of Hui Tea needs to be improved. Under the background of “ going out” national strategy, the promotion of Hui Tea culture can lay a foundation for internationalization of Hui Tea. Hui tea has a long history and rich connotations. Introducing Hui Tea culture, as the first step of popularization, can help Anhui tea enterprises to “ go out” and bring new opportunities for the economic development of Anhui.
