								<h3>The Origin and Development of Tea</h3>
								<p>1.The origin of Chinese tea:
 In ancient history, tea has many names. Sima Xiangru first called tea “Chuan Cha” in "Fanjiang" in the Han Dynasty. Later, it also has the name of “She”, “Chuan”, etc. With the development of tea, the use frequency of the name of “tea” is getting higher and higher. Therefore, the word "tea" is simplified from the complicated word. According to ancient books, wild tea was discovered as early as 1700 years ago in China. The southwest region of China, mainly including Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, is the place where tea trees were first discovered, utilized and cultivated in the world, and the wild large tea trees there show the most primitive characteristics. The wild large tea trees found in China have the most ancient history, the largest number, the wider distribution and the most characteristics in the world in its early time.



	</p> 
								<p>2. Development of Tea Drinking
 According to Lu Yu’s The Classic of Tea · Six Drinks in the Tang Dynasty, drinking tea contains three meanings: the first is to eat tea; The second is drinking tea; the third is tasting tea. By the Tang Dynasty, tea had become a necessity of daily life. Drinking tea is the process that the boiling water is steeped into the teapot and then the soup is divided into cups for drinking, without adding any physical objects. The use of tea evolves, first is to be eaten, then is to be drunk, finally is to be tasted. Eat tea with fresh leaves for food; Drink tea with fresh leaves to for soup; Tasting tea is to make tea for beverage. They have different uses, different purposes and different functions. Tea as a drink, there are division of drinking, tasting and judging tea. Drinking tea is to meet the physiological needs of the human body. It can quench thirst, refresh oneself and help digestion. Tasting tea is a kind of elegant enjoyment in people's life, experiencing the elegance and quality of tea (fragrance). It is a method to evaluate the quality of tea products in teahouse, which is also called comparing tea. With the development of tea drinking, tea, as an ancient drink, has been endowed with many connotations by the Chinese people, including “for taste”, “for interest” and “for Tao”. “For taste” is the first level of drinking tea, refers to the material function of tea, which is its practical aspect and function. For example, drinking tea can help to clear the liver, brighten the eyes, quench thirst, refresh oneself, reduce blood pressure and decrease lipid, which is beneficial to human health and has a certain health-care effect. “For interest” is the aesthetic level of tea drinking, that is, “tea tasting”.

						<h3>The Classification of Tea</h3>
						<p>Since ancient times, there have been rich varieties of Chinese tea. According to the processing degree of products, the tea can be divided into three categories in the market, namely: primary processed tea (raw tea), reprocessed tea (refined tea) and deeply processed tea. Primary processed tea mainly refers to the products produced after the initial processing of fresh leaves. Its characteristics are as follows: fresh tea leaves are taken as raw materials and processed into a specific form of products through a specific production process, and the internal chemical composition of fresh leaves changes qualitatively. According to the degree of oxidation of tea polyphenols, they can be classified into seven major groups, namely green tea, black tea, oolong tea, scented tea, yellow tea, dark tea, and white tea.</p>
						<h3>Tea-tasting</h3>
						<p>Tea-tasting can be divided into four elements: observing the color of tea, smelling the fragrance of tea, experience the taste of tea, and understanding the charm of tea. These four elements make people get aesthetic pleasure from the color, fragrance, taste and charm of tea respectively, and regard tea as a kind of spiritual enjoyment, but also as an artistic pursuit. Different types of tea will form different colors, fragrance, taste and charm, we should carefully sip, slowly observe to feel the beauty of tea from different perspectives .</p>

				<h2>Infusion of Tea</h2>
						<p>Tea brewing must be prepared with utensils, tea and water, and then tea can be drunk after being brewed with boiling water. But it is not easy to brew the tea well and give full play to the inherent color, aroma and taste of tea. Different types of tea, tea quantity, water temperature, utensils and different brewing techniques and methods will affect the results of tea brewing. The most important factors are tea temperature, water temperature and brewing time.</p>

							<h3>The Amount of Tea</h3>
                            <strong class="role">  </strong>
                   
							<p>The amount of tea is the ratio of tea to water. Generally speaking, the tender tea has less tea juice outflow so that it should be put more when brewing while coarse tea has more outflow of tea juice so that it should be put less when brewing. Green tea can be produced by baking and roasting. Under the same ratio of tea to water, the baked green tea soup is generally mellow and light in taste, while the roasted green tea soup has a strong taste.					</p>

							<h3>The Temperature of Water</h3>
                           
                            <p>Lu Yu once wrote in his book The Classics of Tea, “The so-called simmer of water, or the initial boil, is a state when tiny fish-eye bubbles appear with a low rustling sound. Seething is the second stage when strings of crystal beads gush out around the edge of the wok. The third and last stage refers to the ebullient state of water marked with lumpy waves. This draws the line. Exceeding this point, the water is assumed overdone, and should no longer be used for tea.” The ambient temperature of tea should not be too high or too low, and should be controlled about 25℃. </p>

							<h3>Enzyme Inactivation</h3>
							<strong class="role">Enzyme inactivation by steaming/ Enzyme inactivation by frying</strong>
							<p>The first purpose of enzyme inactivation is to completely destroy the activation of enzymes in fresh leaves and stop the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols, so as to obtain the color, aroma and taste of green tea. The second is to emit the smell of immaturity of the tea and enhance tea fragrance. The third is to evaporate part of the water, soften the leaves, enhance toughness and create conditions for rolling.</p>

							<h3>Rolling</h3>
							<strong class="role">Hot Rolling/Cold Rolling</strong>
							<p>The purpose of rolling is to lay a foundation for the tight knot cable of fried green leaves, to moderately destroy the leaf tissue, to knead out tea juice, and to enrich the fragrance when tea is been brewing. Hot rolling is the procedure that leaves are rolled after enzyme inactivation without being spread to cool. Cold rolling is the procedure that leaves are rolled after enzyme inactivation and being spread to cool until the leaf temperature can drop to a certain degree.</p>

							The method of drying method: the drying methods are very different in different places, but the process is generally divided into three procedures, that is Er Qing, San Qing and Huigan. The procedure of Erqing refers to the primary drying process of tea, in the way of plain drying. The procedure of Sanqing refers to the middle process of tea drying, in the way of wok frying.The procedure of Huigan refers to the late technological process of tea drying, which makes the tea fully dry by means of drum drying. </p>
