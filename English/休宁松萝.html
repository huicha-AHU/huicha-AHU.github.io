											It is said that in the reign of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, there were two water jars placed at the gate of Rangfu Temple in Songluo Mountain, which attracted the attention of a pilgrimage. The water jars were covered with green duckweed because of their age. The pilgrims came to the temple and told the old monk that the two water jars were a treasure, and they had to pay 332 gold to buy it, and agreed to take it in three days. As soon as the pilgrims left, the old monk was afraid that the water jar would be stolen. He immediately sent someone to pour out the green duckweed water, wash it and move it into the temple. Three days later, when the pilgrims came and saw that the water jars had been cleaned, they said that the precious gas was clean and that it was no longer useful. The old monk was extremely remorseful, but it was too late. The pilgrims went out of the temple door and turned back, saying that the treasure gas was still in front of the temple, where the green water was poured. If the tea tree was planted, the magic tea would grow. Only three cups of this tea could solve drunkness caused a thousand cup of wine. The old monk planted tea trees according to the instructions, and soon, the tea buds were fragrant enough to give out, so he named it “Songluo Tea”. Two hundred years later, in the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty, Xiuning area suffered epidemics like typhoid and dysentery, people came to Fu Temple to burn incense, worship Buddha and pray for Bodhisattva bless. The monk gave each person a bag of Songluo Tea, and the prescription of “Puji”. Patents with mild diseases who drunk the tea made with boiling water frequently could be cured in two or three days. Patents with serious diseases who took the drink made by this tea and ginger, salt and japonica rice together, or just swallowed the ground could be cured in two or three days. Sure enough, after taking it, the effect was remarkable and the plague was stopped. From then on, the tea became a panacea and became famous all over the world.</p>

				<h3>Hui Tea “Going Out”</h3>
				<p>As early as in Ming and Qing Dynasties, Huizhou Tea was famous with the power of Huizhou merchants. However, it is difficult now for Huizhou Tea to go overseas. One of the difficulties is the cultural obstacle. The West knows litter of Hui Tea. The international status of Hui Tea needs to be improved. Under the background of “ going out” national strategy, the promotion of Hui Tea culture can lay a foundation for internationalization of Hui Tea. Hui tea has a long history and rich connotations. Introducing Hui Tea culture, as the first step of popularization, can help Anhui tea enterprises to “ go out” and bring new opportunities for the economic development of Anhui.
